Story of Data:
This data is telling a story about different firms concerning the revenue made, and how various activities such as employee workload, high-risk cases, as affected the firms over the years 2020–2025.
Data Source:
The dataset comprises 100 entries across various years and firms, covering key audit performance indicators. It includes both quantitative metrics, such as number of engagements, revenue impact, and qualitative assessments, including audit effectiveness scores, client satisfaction scores. The data used for this project was a public dataset downloaded from Kaggle.

Data Splitting:
The dataset was split into two categories.
Category One — Independent Variables: Firm name, Total Audit Engagement, High Risk Cases, Compliance Violation, Employee Workload, Industry Affected, Cases Detected, Customer Line.
Category Two- Dependent Variable: Total Revenue Impact, Audit Effectiveness Score, and Client Satisfaction Score.

Pre-Analysis:
Initial observations show variations in audit engagements, risk assessments, and performance metrics across firms and years. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the financial risk compliance trends of major audit firms across multiple industries over a six-year period (2020–2025) using data visualized in an interactive dashboard. The dataset provided insight into four key firms — Deloitte, PwC, Ernst & Young, and KPMG — with a focus on compliance violations, audit engagements, revenue patterns, employee workload, and industry-wise performance.
Key questions guiding the pre-analysis phase:
Which firms showed the highest audit activity and workload?
How did compliance violations correlate with risk exposure?
What industries contributed most to overall revenue and violations?
Which year marked peak financial performance?

In-Analysis
1. The leading company is Deloitte, while the least company with the least revenue for the year is KPMG with 5447.44 and 5735.11, respectively.
2. The highest revenue was obtained in the year 2021, while the lowest revenue was in the years 2022 and 2023.
3. The top industry leading is the retail industry with 8696.3, and the least leading industry is healthcare with 5475.59.
4. The highest firm compliance violation goes to Deloitte with 3127 while the Lowest goes to KPMG.
5. Employee workload is highest in Deloitte with 1873 while the lowest is KPMG with 1303.
6. Non-compliance rate is highest in transactions above a certain risk score.
7. Certain transaction types exhibit higher non-compliance, suggesting a need for targeted policies.

Recommendations and Observations
Actionable Insights:
1. The leading company is Deloitte while the least company with the least revenue for the year is KPMG with 5447.44 and 5735.11 respectively.
2. The highest revenue was gotten in the year 2021, while the lowest revenue is in the year 2022 and 2023.

6. Implement stricter controls for high-risk transactions.
7. Train compliance teams focused on identified weak areas.
   
Optimizations:
1. KPMG being the least company should find out what the leading company Deloitte is doing to have such revenue, and they should implement any of the discoveries gotten.
2. The highest revenue gotten was 2021, all the firms should improve on their activities to overcome the downward slope of revenue since 2022 as the revenues should increase yearly
3. More attention be given to the least leading industry, which is healthcare, audit the firms more often and to follow all the recommendations given to the auditors.
4. Training should be given to the staffs of Deloitte to educate them on compliance violation and its necessity in any firm
5. The workload of employee in Deloitte should be investigated by management.
6. Allocate more resources for monitoring flagged regions/customers.
7. Enhance compliance checks for product lines prone to risk.
   
Conclusion
The Vineyard Creations dashboard is a rich narrative of compliance, revenue, and operational intensity in the financial risk audit landscape. As aspiring analysts or decision-makers, translating data into strategic decisions, like identifying red flags in compliance or industry diversification, is the core value of this kind of visual storytelling. Compliance correlates strongly with risk scores. Certain segments pose disproportionate risk.
